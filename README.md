# Learning Python

My goal for this repository is to document my progression in learning Python. As a cyber major, the use of Python is critical for CTFs and for scripting in general. I've been exposed to the language a few times in the PicoCTF Practice challenges, but other than that I haven't used it. 

I began learning Java (my first programming language) a year ago in IT Programming Fundamental (COP2512) and again this past semester in IT Object Oriented Programming (COP2513). My progress through the past 2 semesters of Java practice excercises can be viewed [here](https://github.com/side-i/Introduction-to-Java-Programming-and-Data-Structures-11th-Edition). Although the syntax is a little more verbose, I beleive my coding foundation in Java will translate well to Python, since I going from a syntactically strict language to a more lax one. Also, the thought process and logic I learned in my first 2 coding classes will carry over. For example, concepts like if-else statements, while loops, and for loops are all part of Python and many other languages. So although Java is becoming less popular, I still don't beleive it was a waste of time. 

Wish me luck
